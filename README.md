## üìà Betting Strategies

### 1. Masaniello Strategy
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Approach**: Adjusts stake based on bankroll and previous results
- **Best For**: Balanced play with moderate risk

### 2. Martingale Strategy
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Approach**: Doubles stake after each loss to recover previous losses
- **Best For**: Players with large bankrolls willing to take risks

### 3. Fibonacci Strategy
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Approach**: Uses Fibonacci sequence to determine stake after losses
- **Best For**: Progressive recovery with somewhat controlled risk

### 4. D'Alembert Strategy
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Approach**: Increases stake by 1 unit after loss, decreases by 1 after win
- **Best For**: More conservative alternative to Martingale

### 5. Percentage Strategy
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Approach**: Bets a fixed percentage of current bankroll
- **Best For**: Bankroll preservation and steady play

### 6. Kelly Criterion
- **Risk Level**: Moderate
- **Approach**: Calculates optimal bet size based on odds and probability
- **Best For**: Mathematically optimal long-term growth

### 7. Fixed Stake
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Approach**: Always bets the same amount
- **Best For**: Beginners and conservative players
